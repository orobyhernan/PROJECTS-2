#Today we are going to create a password system that enables us to set a 
#3 attempt limit
#first let's create the password

#def create_password():
    #password = input("Please enter a new password: ")
    #return password


#password = create_password()

#while True:
    #password_input = input("Please enter your password:")
    #if password_input == password:
        #print("Log in successful: ")
        #break
    #else:
        #print("Log in failed you fool, please try again")
        
#ThatÂ´s very cool but at the end of the day, we don't want any hacker
#or intruder to have infinite attempts to hack into so we are going to create a system 
#that sets a maximum of 3 attempts before the system is locked

#First let's creat a function that allwos us to generate a password

def create_password():
    password = input("Please enter a new password: ")
    return password

#Now let's assign the value of the password to a variable so we can 
#call the function later on in other strings of code

password = create_password()

#Let's create a security system that locks after 3 failed password 
#input attempts we will use a for loop for this but first let's set the number 
#of maximum attempts

max_attempts = 3

#now we write a loop that locks out the system if the correct password 
#we designed earlier is not inputed within the first three attempts
#but first we have to define that the system is NOT locked out when executing the loop


locked_out = False

for attempt in range(max_attempts):
    password_input = input("Please enter your password: ")
    
    if password_input == password:
        print("Log in successful")
        break
    else:
        #Now we have to set the variable called remaining attempts so the system
        #can calculate how many attempts we have left
        remaining_attempts = max_attempts - attempt - 1
        if remaining_attempts > 0:
            print(f"Log in failed", remaining_attempts , "attempts remaining")
        else:
            print("Max attempts reached, system locked, please contact an admin")
            locked_out = True
            break

#If we havent reached zero attempts yet, with the conditional if (variable) > 0: statement 
#the system will print out how many attempts we still have left. Once we have
#reached the max. number of attempts it will print out the system locked text
#and turn the locked-out variable into true so it locks the system.
